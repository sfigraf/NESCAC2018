# NESCAC2018
Data from NESCAC baseball 2018 with R markdown file summarizing findings. Findings and work include using stepwise regressions to find variables most correlated to winning, using k means clustering to see how the most talented players are grouped, checking it against other players to see if anyone got snubbed, and using the most talented players to predict how that team would perform if they were all on the same team together.
